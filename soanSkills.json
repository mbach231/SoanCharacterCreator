Though there are differences from one pantheon to another, there is a foundation of powers they can call upon to enact what they believe to be for the betterment of all, or in their God’s will. The Divine magic header is different from performers and Thaumaturgists as it is remembering specific prayers to perform specific abilities. For an idea of how to go about creating and using your Divine Incants, see the Cleric Domain Appendix. The other difference is the Sermon ability, which functions much more like a performer as it requires a longer incant to do a much bigger effect. Always check if the Prayer Ability you are purchasing has a Sermon connected to it so you can prepare yourself if the need to use said ability arises. NOTE- Sermons have a performance time and their own Activation cost.  Finally if one so chooses a Divine Caster can pursue the making of Holy Items by Purchasing the Blessing Abilities(see the Crafting Appendix for more information)\n\nDivine Header Power - Place of Prayer - By speaking the words and performing the ceremony you make a holy place, if only for a small time.  With this header power active you may consecrate a place to your faith.  After you perform the ceremony detailed in your Faith packet anyone who enters the space of your faith can reset in ten minutes rather than fifteen.  This effect ends once you make a different header power active."

All Alchemical effects use a base element (aether, air, earth, fire, light, metal, nature, shadow, void, water) to “hold” their effects. Upon purchase you gain your first element for free, this represents knowledge of a specific type of compound.  As you purchase abilities you learn more complex properties that you can apply to your toxins or tonics.  Anyone who takes the Alchemy Header gains the Capacitor Formula immediately"
